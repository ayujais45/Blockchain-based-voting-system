# Blockchain-based-voting-system
The Blockchain Based Voting System represents a decentralized and transparent electoral platform relying upon the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts and aims to provide secure, fraud-rejecting, and verifiable elections. The common methods of voting always suffer from insecurities such as tampering and multiple voting; but here every vote counted gets recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger, which solves these issues completely. Votings would be cast securely with results publicly verifiable and yet, keeping voter anonymity. The system will be scalable, user friendly, and would combine encryption techniques for safeguarding voter identities. Thus, it would deliver a more trustworthy yet efficient way of doing e-voting.
